#Python Pyzza worksheet

##Task 1 - install spyder

* google for the Spyder Python IDE website
* open [Spyder] (https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/installation.html) in a new tab (preferably using Google Chrome)
* download and install Spyder

Pro Tip - some graphical IDEs interfere with the python environment graphical IDEs, so if one doesn't work, try another

##Task 2 - create a new python module

* press create new python module in the Spyder tab (top left)
* pay attention to the 4 step process of making a graphics app

```python
#import libraries
from Tkinter import *
from random import randint

# step 1: create the top level Tk object
canvas=Tk()
canvas.title("a window")

# step 2: create the canvas
# pizza things will go here

# step 3: draw stuff on the canvas
# base
canvas.create_oval(200,200,300,300,fill="brown")

# Step 4: pack the canvas and run the Tk mainloop
canvas.pack()

canvas.mainloop()
```

***

##Task 3 - run and save your work

* click *run* at the top left - did you get what you expected?
  * press this every time you want to see what your code does 
  * this should then appear in modal form labelled 'Tk'


* click *save* at the top left - no URL this time :/
  * the first time you will need to give a file name
  * save the file to a memory stick if you need to transport it

***

##Task 4 - add a base for the pyzza

* Let's start by making the base
  * Note - the cy value (think of the x and y grid) to move it up and down - cx moves it left and right

```python
canvas.create_oval(50,50,450,450,fill="brown")

```
  
* Let's start by putting tomato sauce on the base
  * Note - there is no opacity in a tk canvas

```python
canvas.create_oval(65,65,435,435,fill="red")

```

***

##Task 5 - put all the toppings on

* look up what other toppings, we can have more shapes and colours
  * http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/tkinter/web/index.html

* we can also add them in random places, try this for pepperoni!

```python
colours = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple"]

# create some pepperoni - random 3 places
for x in range(0,15):
    rndX = randint(0,600)
    rndY = randint(0,400)
    rndCol = randint(0, (len(colours)-1))
    canvas.create_oval(rndX,rndY,rndX+50,rndY+50,fill=colours[rndCol])

```

Pro Tip - put the drawing things all together and change the magic numbers for variables

***

Remember to save your file and put it on a memory stick - we will be animating our pyzza next week!
