#Python Pyzza worksheet

##Task 1 - Why Python?

* one of the top two languages in the world, javascript for the front end, python for everythng else. 
** it is used for engineering design, webservers, image processing, games design, office applications
** our safety critical project is 1.08 million lines of a code, we have 3 or 4 times that in Python to make sure it is safe!

Python can be run from the command line, from an desktop IDE, or from an online IDE. It is useful to try all of them to find out which you prefer.

* start a command line prompt using ```cmd```

You can find out the version of python by typing ```python --version```.

2.7.x means you have Python 2 installed

3.5.x means you have Python 3 installed

* type ```python``` to give the ```>>>``` prompt

Python is now running!


##Task 2 - Batteries included

Everything in Python is an ```object```, with a uniform interface built into the language definition. Which means everything you make comes with functions built in, and anything you might like to try probably has a library to match.

* you already know about classes and objects, just not in a programming sense: 
** an object is an instance of a class, where an class is some sort of abstraction of a category of things! 
** *you* are an instance of the class `boy` or of the class `girl`. 
** *you* come with a bunch of attributes that you can do just like every other boy or girl, and then there are attributes special to you - which they call ```overriding```.

You have spent all your life writing and have expectations about what 'strings' can do. So, let's play with your name:

```python
name = "your name"
```

* "your name" is a string that we have labelled ```name``` 

as a string object, it comes with methods and attributes:
```"your name".capitalize()```

gives the same result as 
```name.capitalize()```

you can also count letters:

```len("your name")```

or talk about the n'th character:

```"your name"[3]```

array indexing is interesting in python, so you can do this:

```"your name"[0:3:1]```

where:
* 0 is the start
* 3 is the end
* 1 is the step length

but what does ```"your name"[::-1]``` do?


# so, things in python have behaviour defined by Python itself, perhaps by the package it belongs to, and by programs that you write.


##Task 4 - A graphics app

* There are lots of graphics packages for python, Tkinter is one of the oldest. The name 'Tkinter' is the python interface to Tk, a cross-platform graphics toolkit, embedded in many applications, from engineering and design to office applications.

* you can use Tkinter to make office forms or do something exciting, and there is always a basic template for making a graphics app:

** import the libraries
** create the top level object
** attach a canvas
** draw things
** pack the canvas
** run the mainloop

* some of the steps may be hidden by the package, but it is useful to keep remembering the basic template

```python
# import libraries
from Tkinter import * 
```

# create the top level Tk object
```python
window=Tk()
window.title("a window")
```

# create the canvas
```python
canvas = Canvas(window, 600,600)
```

* pizza things will go here

# draw stuff on the canvas

```python
canvas.create_oval(200,200,300,300,fill="brown")
```

* this might be the base of the pizza

# pack the canvas and run the Tk mainloop
```python
canvas.pack()
window.mainloop()
```

# draw some more stuff

```python
canvas.create_oval(200,200,300,300,fill="brown")
```

* this might be the tomato sauce toppings
* now add your cheese and anything else, before we get to the pepperoni


***

##Task 5 - run and save your work

* click *run* at the top left - did you get what you expected?
  * press this every time you want to see what your code does 
  * this should then appear in modal form labelled 'Tk'


* click *save* at the top left - no URL this time :/
  * the first time you will need to give a file name
  * save the file to a memory stick if you need to transport it

***

##Task 6 - add a base for the PyZza

* Let's start by making the base
  * Note - the numbers give a bounding box for the oval

```python
canvas.create_oval(50,50,450,450,fill="brown")

```
  
* Let's start by putting tomato sauce on the base
  * Note - there is no opacity in a tk canvas, so the layers are important

```python
canvas.create_oval(65,65,435,435,fill="red")

```

***

##Task 7 - put all the toppings on

* look up what other toppings, we can have more shapes and colours
  * http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/tkinter/web/index.html

* we can also add them in random places, try this for pepperoni!

```python
colours = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple"]

# create some pepperoni - random 3 places
for x in range(15):
    rndX = randint(0,600)
    rndY = randint(0,400)
    rndCol = randint(0, (len(colours)-1))
    canvas.create_oval(rndX,rndY,rndX+50,rndY+50,fill=colours[rndCol])

```

Pro Tip - put the drawing things all together and change the magic numbers for variables

***

Remember to save your file and put it on a memory stick - we will be animating our pyzza next week!
